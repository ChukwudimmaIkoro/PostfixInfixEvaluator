# Postfix & Infix Evaluator

Application that takes in basic arithmetic equations and solves them using stacks

● Created a program that takes in equations involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses, and exponents and solves them using stacks and precedence rules.

● Implemented methods that allow for both postfix and infix equations to be solved with the program.

● Implemented postfix equations solution using one stack and infix equations using two stacks.
